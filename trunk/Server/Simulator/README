= Magic Lego Blimps: Robot Simulator ===========================================
================================================================================

This program allows the server group to test our quality of service and 
artificial intelligence algorithms without the need for setting up physical 
robots, cameras, and objects of interest. It is written in Java using the Swing
framework as this was the easiest way to get a cross-platform graphical program
up and running.

Quick compile and run:
    
    0) Start from the magiclegoblimps/Server/Simulator directory.
    
    1) Create a directory to hold the class files.
        `mkdir build`
    
    2) Compile the source files.
        `javac -d build src/magiclegoblimps/*.java`
    
    3) Run the program.
        `cd build`
        `java magiclegoblimps.Main`
