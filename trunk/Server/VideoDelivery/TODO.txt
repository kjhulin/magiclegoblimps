A categorized list of things we still need to do for our project.

>>> For server group:
    * Adapt to QoS server protocol (it's still not final)

>>> For client group:
    * Generate CSV files automatically (we may no longer need this)
    * Call stored procedures for client database
    * Get auto play working for live feeds on flow player

>>> For robot group:
    * Get cameras on university network - do we need to put a request into
      IR? ...IMPORTANT!!!

>>> For us:
    * Analyze QoS and archive videos
    * Make vidcontrol.py able to handle connection interruptions (it
      shouldn't quit when a connection is dropped or a cam feed is lost)
    * Ability to sense dropped cam feeds (for example, if an ffmpeg
      instance crashes)
    * Poll child processes to make sure they're still running
    * PERFORMANCE: explore ways to reduce latency and latency buildup for stale  
      streams
    * startup script -- if necessary

>>> For testing:
    * Update html pages on our server for the live and archive streams
    * test launching/killing ffserver/ffmpeg processes with live cameras
    * QoS server simulator (test for adding/removing streams)
        -- server-sim use QoS response format
        -- server-sim add/remove urls randomly

>>> For documentation:
    * Add/revise comments in the code
    * Document server setup
        - os/version
        - required software packages
        - configuration settings
        - installation paths
    * End-user guide (probably should be a manual geared towards portal admins)
        - installlation
        - starting
        - stopping
        - configuration
        - troubleshooting
        - testing the installation
